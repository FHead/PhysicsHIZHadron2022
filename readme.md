# ZHadron code!

## Instructions 

First clone this repository somewhere

Make sure you have `root` setup

Every time you start a new shell, this will need to be done: at the base directory, execute the `SetupAnalysis.sh` which will set the necessary environment variables
```
. SetupAnalysis.sh
```

Then go into the `CommonCode` directory and compile by typing `make` to compile the basic things

And have fun with things!


## Code structure

The folders for codes follow a two-layer structure.  The base folder is like the category, and the subfolder is the unit for specific piece of code.

| Base folder | Explanation |
|---|---|
| `CommonCode` | contains all the necessary shared header files |
| `Example` | contains some examples to run things |
| `BasicDistribution` | code to make basic distribution plots |
